Mender Configure Module
=======================

Mender is an open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater for embedded Linux
devices. Mender comprises a client running at the embedded device, as well as
a server that manages deployments across many devices.

This repository contains the artifacts library, which is used by the
Mender client, command line interface, server and for build integration with the Yocto Project.

The artifacts library makes it easy to programmatically work with a Mender artifact, which
is a file that can be recognized by its `.mender` suffix. Mender artifacts
can contain binaries, metadata, checksums, signatures and scripts that are
used during a deployment. The artifact format acts as a wrapper, and
uses the `tar` format to bundle several files into one.

In its simplest form, an artifact contains just a rootfs image,
along with its checksum, id and device type compatibility.


The artifacts library might also be useful for other updaters or
purposes. We are always happy to see other uses of it!
